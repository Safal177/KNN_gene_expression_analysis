# KNN gene expression data nalysis
In this project, I have shown my skills on “gene_expression.csv” dataset analysis using. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to find whether cancer presence or not. 
# Project outline:  
•	KNN
•	scikit-learn
•	Data preprocessing
•	Scaling data, 
•	Train model
•	Evaluation model
•	GridSearchCV
•	Find Metrices (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, F1-Score)
•	Best model achieve at k =24 neighbors, with accuracy about 93%
# File:
•	Python_Machine_Learning_K_Nearest_Neighbors (KNN)_project_04.pdf. It has python codes with results and visualizations. 
# Dataset:
•	Downloaded from Kaggle (gene_expression.csv dataset). Data was used for my educational and portfolio purposes.
